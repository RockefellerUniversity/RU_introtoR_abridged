**R** is a scripting language and environment for **statistical computing**.


Developed by [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_%28statistician%29) and [Ross Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka). 


Inheriting much from **S** (Bell labs).

- Suited to high level data analysis
- Open source & cross platform
- Extensive graphics capabilities
- Diverse range of add-on packages
- Active community of developers
- Thorough documentation


---
## What is R to you?

.pull-left[

**R** comes with excellent "out-of-the-box" statistical and plotting capabilities.


**R** provides access to 1000s of packages ([CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/)/[MRAN](http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/)/[R-forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/)) which extend the basic functionality of R while maintaining high quality documentation.


In particular, [Robert Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_%28statistician%29) developed the **[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/)** project where 100's of packages are directly related to computational biology and analysis of associated high-throughput experiments.

}

```


## Different Data types in R

- Simple calculations
- Variables
- Vectors
- Matrices (we will not cover these)
- Data frames
- Lists


---
## Simple Calculations 

At its most basic, **R** can be used as a simple calculator.
```{r simpleCalculations_introtoR,prompt=T}
3+1

2*2

sqrt(25)-1
```

---
## Using functions

The **sqrt(25)** demonstrates the use of functions in R. A function performs a complex operation on it's arguments and returns the result.

In R, arguments are provided to a function within the parenthesis -- **( )** -- that follows the function name. So **sqrt(*ARGUMENT*)** will provide the square root of the value of ***ARGUMENT***.

Other examples of functions include **min()**, **sum()**, **max()**. 

Note multiple arguments are separated by a comma.

```{r usingFunctions_introtoR}
min(2, 4, 6)
sum(2, 4, 6)
max(2, 4, 6)
```


---
## Using functions

R has many useful functions "built in" and ready to use as soon as R is loaded.

An incomplete, illustrative list can be seen [here](http://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html) 

In addition to R standard functions, additional functionality can be loaded into R using libraries. These include specialized tools for areas such as sequence alignment, read counting etc.

If you need to see how a function works try **?** in front of the function name.
```{r usingFunctionsSQRT_introtoR}
?sqrt
```


Lets run [**?sqrt**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/MathFun.html) in RStudio and look at the help.


---
## Using functions
**Arguments have names and order**

With functions such as min() and sqrt(), the arguments to be provided are obvious and the order of these arguments doesnt matter.

```{r usingFunctionsArgOrder_introtoR}
min(5, 4, 6)
min(6, 4, 5)
```

Many functions however have an order to their arguments.
Try and look at the arguments for the dir() function using [?dir](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/list.files.html).

```
?dir
```

---
## Using functions
**Setting names for arguments**

Often we know the names of arguments but not necessarily their order.
In cases where we want to be sure we specify the right argument, we provide names for the arguments used.

```{r usingFunctionsSetNames_introtoR,eval=F}
dir()
dir(full.names=T)
```

This also means we don't have to copy out all the defaults for arguments preceding it.

```{r usingFunctionsDefaultOrder_introtoR,eval=F}
dir(full.names=T)
# Is equivalent to...
dir(".", NULL, FALSE, T)
```

---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Variables

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Variables

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## Variables 


As with other programming languages and even graphical calculators, **R** makes use of **variables**.

A **variable** stores a value as a letter or word.

In **R**, we make use of the assignment operator **<-** 

```{r variablesDefine_introtoR}
x <- 10
```
Now **x** holds the value of 10
```{r variableHold_introtoR}
x
```


---
## Altering variables


```{r variableShowForAlterInPlace_introtoR}
x
```

Variables can be altered in place
```{r variableAlterInPlace_introtoR}
x <- 20
x
```

---

## Using variables                                                                                        
Variables can be used just as the values they contain.
```{r variableAsValueTheyContain_introtoR}
x
```

```{r variableAsValueFromFunTheyContain_introtoR}
x + sqrt(25)
```
Variables can be used to create new variables
```{r variableCreateNewVariable_introtoR}
y <- x + sqrt(25)
y
```

---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Vectors

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Vectors

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## Vectors

In **R** the most basic variable or data type is a **vector**. A vector is an ordered collection of values. The x and y variables we have previously assigned are examples of a vector of length 1.

```{r vectorBasic_introtoR}
x
length(x)
```

---
## Vectors

To create a multiple value vector we use the function **c()** to *combine* the supplied arguments into one vector.

```{r vectorCreate_introtoR}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
x
length(x)
```


---
## Vectors

Vectors of continuous stretches of values can be created using a colon (**:**) as a shortcut.

```{r vectorSeqFromColon_introtoR}
y <- 6:10
y
```

---
## Indexing 

Square brackets **[]** identify the position within a vector (the **index**).
These indices can be used to extract relevant values from vectors.

NOTE: This vector is not made of numbers. This is called a character vector.


```{r vectorIndexing_introtoR}
z <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f")
z
z[1]
z[4]
```

---
## Indexing 


Indices can be used to extract values from multiple positions within a vector.

```{r vectorIndexingBy2_introtoR}
z[c(1,4)]
```
Negative indices can be used to extract all positions except that specified.

```{r vectorIndexingByNeg_introtoR}
z[-5]
```



---
## Indexing and replacement

We can use indices to modify a specific position in a vector.

```{r vectorIndexingAndReplace_introtoR}
z
z[5] <- "Hello"
z
```


---
## Indexing and replacement

Indices can be specified using other vectors.

```{r vectorIndexingUsingVectors_introtoR}
y
z[y] <- "Hello again"
z
```


---
## Remember!


Square brackets **[]**  for indexing.
```{r RememberSquareForIndex_introtoR}
x[1]
```

Parentheses **()**  for function argments.
```{r RememberRoundForFunctions_introtoR}
sqrt(4)
```


---
## Arithmetic operations 

Vectors can also be used in arithmetic operations. When a standard arithmetic operation is applied to vector, the operation is applied to each position in a vector.

```{r vectorArithmetricOperations_introtoR}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
x
y <- x*2
y
```

Multiple vectors can be used within arithmetic operations. 
```{r vectorArithmetricOperationsMultipleVectors_introtoR}
x+y
```

---
## Arithmetic operations  

When applying an arithmetic operation between two vectors of unequal length, the shorter will be recycled.

```{r vectorRecycle_introtoR}
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
x
x+c(1,2)
```

```{r vectorShorterRecycle_introtoR}
x+c(1,2,3)
```

---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Factors

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Factors

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## Creating factors

A special case of a vector is a **factor**.

Factors are used to store data which may be grouped in categories (categorical data).
Specifying data as categorical allows R to properly handle the data and make use of functions specific to categorical data.

To create a factor from a vector we use the **factor()** function. Note that the factor now has an additional component called **"levels"** which identifies all categories within the vector.

```{r factorsIntro_introtoR}
vectorExample <- c("male","female","female","female")
factorExample <- factor(vectorExample)
factorExample
levels(factorExample)
```


---
## Summary() function


An example of the use of levels can be seen from applying the **summary()** function to the vector and factor examples


```{r factorsSummaryFunction_introtoR}
summary(vectorExample)
summary(factorExample)
```



---
## Display order of levels

In our factor example, the levels have been displayed in an alphabetical order. To adjust the display order of levels in a factor, we can supply the desired display order to **levels** argument in the **factor()** function call.

```{r factorsDisplayOrder_introtoR}
factorExample <- factor(vectorExample, levels=c("male","female"))
factorExample
summary(factorExample)
```

---
## Nominal factors

In some cases there is no natural order to the categories such that one category is greater than the other (nominal data). By default this is not the case. 

```{r factorsNominal_introtoR}
factorExample <- factor(vectorExample, levels=c("male","female"))
factorExample[1] < factorExample[2]
```

---
## Ordinal factors

In other cases there will be a natural ordering to the categories (ordinal data). A factor can be specified to be ordered using the **ordered** argument in combination with specified levels argument.

```{r factorsOrdinal_introtoR}
factorExample <- factor(c("small","big","big","small"),
                        ordered=TRUE,levels=c("small","big"))
factorExample
factorExample[1] < factorExample[2]
```

---
## Replacement

Unlike vectors, replacing elements within a factor isn't so easy. While replacing one element with an established level is possible, replacing with a novel element will result in a warning.

```{r factorsOrder_introtoR}
factorExample <- factor(c("small","big","big","small"))
factorExample[1] <- c("big")
factorExample

factorExample[1] <- c("huge")
factorExample

```

---
## Replacement

To add a new level we can use the levels argument.

```{r factorsAddNew_introtoR}
levels(factorExample) <- c("big","small","huge")
factorExample[1] <- c("huge")
factorExample
```

---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Data Frames

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Data Frames

---
"    
  )
  
}

```


All progamming languages have a concept of a table. In **R**, the most useful type is a **data frame**.

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/ExcelMat.jpg" alt="igv" height="300" width="600">
</div>

---
## Creating data frames 

In R, we make use of the **data frame** object which allows us to store tables with columns of different data types. To create a data frame we can simply use the **data.frame()** function.

```{r dataframesIntro_introtoR}
patientName <- c("patient1","patient2","patient3","patient4")
patientType <- factor(rep(c("male","female"),2))
survivalTime <- c(1,30,2,20)
dfExample <- data.frame(Name=patientName, Type=patientType, Survival_Time=survivalTime)
dfExample
```

---
## Indexing

Selecting and replacing portions of a data frame can be done by **indexing** using square brackets **[]** much like for vectors.

When indexing data frames, two values may be provided within the square brackets separated by a comma to retrieve information on a data frame position.

The first value(s) corresponds to row(s) and the second to column(s).

- ***myDataFrame[rowOfInterest,columnOfInterest]***

---
## Indexing

```{r matricesIndexingShow_introtoR}
dfExample
```
Value of first column, second row
```{r matricesIndexingExample_introtoR}
dfExample[2,1]
```


---
## Indexing 

Similarly, whole rows or columns can be extracted. Single rows and columns will return a vector.  

Values of second column (row index is empty!)
```{r matricesIndexingExampleByCol_introtoR}
dfExample[,2]
```

Values of third row (column index is empty!)
```{r matricesIndexingExampleByRow_introtoR}
dfExample[3,]
```

---
## Indexing 

When multiple columns or row indices are specified, a matrix is returned.

Values of second and third row (column index is empty!)
```{r matricesIndexingExampleByMultipleRow_introtoR}
dfExample[c(2,3),]
```


---
## Indexing and replacement

Replacement can occur in the same way we have seen for less complex data types: use the assignment operator *<-*

```{r dataframesNoReplace_introtoR}
dfExample[1,3] <- "Forever"
dfExample
```

---
## Indexing and replacement

When we work with factors, for a replacement to be successful it has to be a possible level.

```{r dataframesNoReplaceString_introtoR}
dfExample[1,"Type"] <- "other"
dfExample
```

---
## Factors in data frames

It is possible to update factors in data frames just as with standard factors.

```{r dataframesAndFactors_introtoR}
dfExample <- data.frame(Name=patientName,Type=patientType,
                        Survival_Time=survivalTime)

levels(dfExample[,"Type"]) <- c(levels(dfExample[,"Type"]) ,
                                "other")

dfExample[1,"Type"] <- "other"
dfExample

```


---
## Indexing and replacement

Data frames may be indexed just [as matrices](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Intro_To_R_1Day/presentations/singlepage/introToR_Session1.html#Indexing).

```{r dataframesReplacement_introtoR}
dfExample
dfExample[dfExample[,"Survival_Time"] > 10,]
```

---
## Specify columns with $

It is ALSO possible to index a data frames column by using the **$** symbol.

```{r dataframesReplacementbyDollar_introtoR}
dfExample <- data.frame(Name=patientName,Type=patientType,Survival_Time=survivalTime)
dfExample$Survival_Time
```

---
## Create columns with $

The **$** operator also allows for the creation of new columns for a data frame on the fly.

```{r dataframesNewbyDollar_introtoR}
dfExample
dfExample$newColumn <- rep("newData",nrow(dfExample))
dfExample
```

---
## Finding dimensions

To find dimensions of a data frame, the **dim()** function will provide dimensions as the row then column number while **nrow()** and **ncol()** will return just row number and column number respectively.
```{r matricesDim_introtoR}
dim(dfExample)
nrow(dfExample)
ncol(dfExample)
```


---
## Joining vectors and data frames


A data frame can be created from multiple vectors or other data frames.

**cbind()** can be used to attach data to a data frame as columns.
```{r matricesCbind_introtoR}
x <- 1:4
newDF <- cbind(x,dfExample)
newDF
```

---
## Joining vectors and data frames

**rbind()** functions to bind to a data frame as rows.
```{r matricesRbind_introtoR}
z <- c(5,"patient5","male",25)
newerDF <- rbind(newDF,z)
newerDF
```


---
```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

# Lists

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#EB811B' size=1px width=720px></html> 

---
"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Lists

---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## Creating lists

Lists are the final data type we will look at. 

In R, lists provide a general container which can hold any data type. 

```{r listsExample_introtoR}
firstElement <- 10
secondElement <- c("a","b","c","d")
thirdElement <- data.frame(colOne=c(1,2,4,5),colTwo=c("One","Two","Three","Four"))
```

---
## lists
To create a list we can simply use the **list()** function with arguments specifying the data we wish to include in the list.

```{r listsCreate_introtoR}
myList <- list(firstElement, secondElement, thirdElement)
myList
```


---
## Indexing

List, as with other data types in R, can be indexed. In contrast to other types, using **[]** on a list will subset the list to another list of selected indices. To retrieve an element from a list in R , two square brackets **[[]]** must be used. 

```{r listsCreateElements_introtoR}
myList <- list(firstElement,secondElement,thirdElement)
myList[1]
myList[[1]]
```

---
## Joining lists

Again, similar to vectors, lists can be joined together in R using the c() function

```{r listsCombine_introtoR}
myNamedList <- list(First=firstElement,Second=secondElement,
                    Third=thirdElement)
myNamedList <- c(myNamedList,list(fourth=c(4,4)))
myNamedList[c(1,4)]

```


---
## Flattening lists

Sometimes you will wish to "flatten" out a list. When a list contains compatible objects, i.e. list of all one type, the **unlist()** function can be used.

```{r listsFlatten_introtoR}
myNamedList <- list(First=c(1,2,3),Second=c(2,6,7),Third=c(1,4,7))
myNamedList
flatList <- unlist(myNamedList)
flatList[1:7]
```
